Assignment 6: Hex++ w/ GUI

This program implements a Monte Carlo AI player for the Hex game.

By running a large number of randomized game simulations before each possible
move, the program is able to determine which move it needs to take to get the 
highest probability of winning. The computer takes about 5-7 seconds to decide
on which move to make on our machines, but your mileage may vary.

We developed and tested on OSX, but the program is also confirmed to work on 
Unix with SSH. The user should interact with the program from the command line, 
and the GUI window will update accordingly after each move has been made.

(A note on Unix: ssh -Y was required in our use case, rather than the suggested 
ssh -X command from Piazza)

Through completing this program, we learned the true value of friendship, and
the secret meaning of Christmas. Also, we learned that GUI programming is sort
of weird. We forked our GUI portion of the program from some of the example code
that was given out, and it had defined the locations of the screen via glOrtho
in a way that confused us for a while until we finally figured it out.
